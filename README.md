## What it does
Nut Jump is an arcade game based on Neopets' "Hasee Bounce". Play as two adorable squirrel brothers and catch as many nuts as you can within the time limit!

## What I learned
This project put my game development skills to test. Interacting with keyboard events, making random game elements, and making hitboxes were all new things that I was able to learn. Using python's tkinter toolkit was important as well!

## Next steps
I wish Nut Jump could somehow be accessible online for anyone to play! Another next step would be to make the graphics and overall gameplay smoother.
